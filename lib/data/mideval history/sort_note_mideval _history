Medieval India refers to a long period of Post-classical history of the Indian subcontinent between the "ancient period"
and "modern period". It is usually regarded as running approximately from the breakup of the Gupta Empire in the 6th
century AD and the start of the Early modern period in 1526 with start of the Mughal Empire, although some historians
regard it as both starting and finishing later than these points. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early
medieval period and Late medieval era.
